# Agentic Architecture using Bedrock Agents

This repository demonstrates the architecture and implementation of an agent-based AI system using AWS Bedrock Agents and the Bedrock large language model. The architecture leverages Amazon Bedrock, Knowledge base, AWS Lambda, S3, OpenSearch and Aurora RDS database, and uses a variety of agents (Database Agent, API Agent, KB Agent) to provide an interactive and functional AI-driven experience.

## Architecture Overview

### Components:
1. **Users and GUI**: End-users interact with the system through a graphical interface (Streamlit GUI), initiating queries and requests.
   
2. **Agents**:
   - **Orchestrator Agent**: User facing, responsible for task decomposition, planning, directing to other agents in executing subtasks.
   - **KB Agent**: Manages knowledge base interactions, with access to a Q&A KB sourced in OpenSearch and S3.
   - **Query Generation Agent**: Interacts with the Aurora RDS database to retrieve and update information.
   - **Query Correction Agent**: Automatically corrects SQL queries to ensure they are processed correctly. This agent helps improve the accuracy of database interactions by refining and adjusting gernrated SQL query as needed.
   - **API Agent**: Handles communication with external APIs

3. **AWS Lambda**:
   - **Rest API Lambda**: Executes API requests and interacts with RDS for database operations.
   - **Database Lambda**: Executes SQL, enabling dynamic database interactions. It also works alongside the Query Correction Agent to ensure queries are valid.

4. **Data Sources**:
   - **RDS**: The primary database.
   - **S3 Sources**: Data is stored in S3 for both the database knowledge base and Q&A knowledge base.
   - **Database Structure**: ![Database Structure](images/petstore-er.png)

5. **Bedrock Model - Claude**: The system leverages Claude as the model for natural language understanding and interaction with the agents.

### Flow:
Users make requests through the GUI, which are handled by the corresponding agents. Depending on the request type (Database, API, or Knowledge Base), Bedrock will invoke appropriate AWS Lambda functions from the action group to process the request, interacting with the underlying data sources and generating responses that are then returned to the users. The Query Correction Agent ensures reivew the user question, existing SQL query and the query execution error to update the SQL query for Database Lambda.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a bucket for the Lambda assets

In your AWS S3 console, create a bucket for your Lambda code artifacts. You can name it, for example,my-lambda-assets-<your-aws-account-no>

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/agentic-architecture-using-bedrock.git
   cd agentic-architecture-using-bedrock
   ```

3. **Edit the ci-cd/template.yaml Cloudformation template file and update the _MyAssetsBucketName_ parameter with your bucket name above. Replace the _KeyPair_ parameter with your EC2 keypair name. 

4. **Upload the Lambda code assets to the S3 bucket you created above by running the script below. 
   ```
   cd application/lambdas
   ./upload_lambdas.sh my-lambda-assets-<your-aws-account-no>

5. **Deploy the cloudformation template.yaml file
   ```bash
   cd ci-cd
   aws cloudformation deploy \
    --template-file ./template.yaml \
    --stack-name Agentic-Architecture-Stack \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
    --region us-west-2
   ```

6. **Set up the Database and knowledge base**:
   - run dataloader.sh from Cloudshell from the private subnet

7. **Set up the Streamlit App**:
   - The `application/streamlit/` folder contains the Streamlit application that serves the GUI for user interaction.
   - Run the app locally using:
     ```bash
     python -m streamlit run application/streamlit/agents.py
     ```

## Usage
Once the system is set up, users can interact with the agents via the streamlit GUI. Queries are processed and sent to the appropriate agent for resolution. The system supports various functionalities, including:
- Text-to-SQL query conversion for database interaction.
- REST API handling for external integrations.
- Knowledge base queries for fetching information stored in the Q&A database.
- Automatic query correction to improve the accuracy of database queries.
